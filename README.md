# Dotfiles
A set of configuration files for developmental purposes. Particularly useful is
setting up a new computer quickly.

## Disclaimer
Since I've built these for my workflow, they may require some (major) tweaking
if you want to use them. Please review the code and modify things as you see
fit. These dotfiles have only been tested on MacOS; other OS maybe not work as
intended.
