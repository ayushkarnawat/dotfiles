# Dotfiles
A set of configuration files for software development purposes. Particularly
useful for setting up a new computer quickly.

## Installing

### Nix
Follow the instructions for installing the latest version
[here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Installation_Guide).

### Tmux
Since we are not using homebrew, we have to compile Tmux manually.

## Disclaimer
Since I've built these for my workflow, it may require some (potentially major)
tweaks if you want to use them. Please review the code and modify things as you
see fit. These dotfiles have only been tested on MacOS; other OS maybe not work.
